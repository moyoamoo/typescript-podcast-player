# Podcast Player

This is the frontend for the final project made during The Jump Software Development Bootcamp. The project is a web based podcast player with a custom audio player with controls (play, pause, volume controls, next and previous track, shows buffered duration). Each second a request is made to the API to keep track of how many listens per second of any podcast.

Users can search for a podcast and add to their library when signed in. They can view their most listened, favourite genres and previous searches. The user can log in, create an account, update their account details and delete their account.
